# Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on text mining and sentiment analysis using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It preprocesses textual data, extracts features, and builds models to classify sentiment scores based on user reviews. The project includes traditional machine learning approaches (e.g., Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors) as well as advanced deep learning models like Bidirectional LSTMs.

## Features

### 1. **Dataset**
- The dataset contains user reviews and corresponding sentiment scores.
- Columns include:
  - `Score`: Sentiment score (e.g., 1â€“5).
  - `Text`: User review text.

### 2. **Text Preprocessing**
- Tokenization using `nltk.word_tokenize`.
- Removal of stopwords and punctuation.
- Lemmatization using `WordNetLemmatizer`.
- Part-of-speech tagging for better context understanding.

### 3. **Feature Extraction**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into numerical features based on term frequency-inverse document frequency.
- **Embedding Layers**: Used in deep learning models to represent words as dense vectors.

### 4. **Models**
#### **Machine Learning Models**
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on word frequencies.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies text based on similarity to neighboring data points.

#### **Deep Learning Models**
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Captures context in both forward and backward directions for improved sentiment classification.
- **CNN**: Extracts features from sequences using convolutional layers for sentiment prediction.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
Metrics used for evaluation include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
